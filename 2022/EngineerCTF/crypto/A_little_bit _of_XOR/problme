A little bit of XOR
296
Rox has encrypted our secret F with a integer key k and has left us with 0010010 10000101 10010111 10001010 10110001 10101110 10010011 11000000 10000101 10101110 11000001 10010111 10101110 10101001 11000001 10100011 10001100. Fortunately (or unfortunately ?), the key k was also used to encrypt c resulting in 10010111 10011110 10000011 11011100 10101110 10010000 10011101 10011101. Rox obtained c by applying a special operation on 110010 11101 10111 1001100 101100 10100 11110 1001 and a Treasure.

Can you please obtain our secret F ?
